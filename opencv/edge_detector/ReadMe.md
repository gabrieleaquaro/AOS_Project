# BOSP: Adaptive Execution Model porting of "OpenCV EdgeDetector"

This repo contains the src code of a porting of the OpenCV sample,
edge.cpp, (available at this
[link](https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d6/d56/samples_2cpp_2edge_8cpp-example.html))
to the Adaptive Execution Model used by the framework Barbeque Run-Time
Resource Manager (BarbequeRTRM) (more info
[here](https://bosp.deib.polimi.it/doku.php?id=start))<br/>

1. To can build the application it is necessary to have OpenCV library
installed on the machine.<br/> 
2. The default installation path for the BarbequeRTRM is ~/BOSP<br/>
3. Once the application is built just run it in the bosp shell using the
command "edgedetect", or "facedect --filename=path_to_file" for parsing a give image<br/>
